/**
 * Taking what is planned here and putting it somewhere else, offered under the
 * list of what that is.
 *
 * Plain rather than leading, and offered only where the list has something in
 * it. Beside a table that has just said what the device will hold, this is one
 * thing to do about the device among several, not the point of the view; and
 * under a view that has just said nothing is planned, it would promise the move
 * of nothing.
 *
 * The mark travels with the offer, so the same act is recognizable wherever it
 * is made. It is laid out beside the words rather than through the button's own
 * icon slot, which sets it smaller and on the text's baseline: next to the menu
 * that lays its mark out the first way, the two read as a pair of different
 * things rather than as two offers of the same kind.
 *
 * Always open. Whether the move can be made is settled in the dialog it opens,
 * which is where the reader sees what there is to move to; a button that knows
 * the answer in advance is a button that has to explain itself before the
 * reader has asked anything.
 *
 * It is the page's {@link ChangeInstallationDisk} in a different place and
 * nothing more today. They are two components because they are heading apart:
 * that one is about where the installation goes, this one about where some part
 * of it goes, and only the first of those is the whole plan.
