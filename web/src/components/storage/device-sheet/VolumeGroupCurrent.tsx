/**
 * Where a volume group being defined will find its room.
 *
 * A group the machine already has is read from the machine. A group being
 * defined has nothing to read: it exists only in the plan, and what a reader
 * wants to know about it is which disks it will stand on, because those are the
 * devices whose current content is at stake.
 *
 * So what is said here is not what the group holds but what it will take, named
 * disk by disk and reachable: a disk named in a sentence is a disk the reader
 * may want to open, and the panel they are in is not the one that decides what
 * happens to what is on it.
 *
 * "Any needed" rather than a count. How many partitions the group will take,
 * and how large, is settled by what is asked of it, and a number here would be
 * a promise this panel cannot keep.
