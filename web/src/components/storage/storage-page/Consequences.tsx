 * different kinds of thing, and a reader looking for theirs knows it by its
 * kind. Only where both are shrunk are they named together, because that is the
 * only case where neither word alone is true.
 *
 * The count is of everything shrunk, not of the kind named. Where the kinds are
 * mixed the clause names both, so the number has to cover both; and where they
 * are not, there is only one kind to count.
 *
 * Anything that is neither falls in with the mixed case rather than inventing a
 * third wording for it. A shrunken RAID is not a partition, but it is sharing
 * the sentence with things that are, and "partitions and logical volumes" is
 * the phrase this already has for a plan whose parts do not go by one word.

/**
 * The worst thing the plan does to what is already on the machine, named.
 *
 * A reader wants to know whether any of the installation matters to them, and
 * a count of actions does not answer that. Naming the worst act does, in one
 * clause, without becoming a paragraph of consequences.
 *
 * Deliberately not a summary. Where a plan both deletes and shrinks, only the
 * deletion is named: what this says is the worst of it, not all of it. And a
 * name always survives, however many there are, because "3 existing systems"
 * tells a reader with Windows on the disk nothing they can recognize.
 *
 * It is a statement and not a control. The color belongs to the loss rather
 * than to anything the reader can press, and nothing rides on seeing it: the
 * words say what is deleted.
 *
 * Read from the actions the solver produced, so it reports what will happen
 * rather than what the configuration asked for. Nothing is reported when there
 * is no proposal to read, which is what leaves room for the page to say why.
 *
 * Beside it, and never colored with it, the way into the whole picture. What
 * the plan destroys and what it does step by step are two questions, and a
 * reader has the first whether or not they ever have the second. A link that
 * changes appearance with what the plan happens to do is a link they have to
 * recognize twice, and its danger was never its own: it opens a list.
 *
 * "Needed" rather than "in total": the number follows from the plan the reader
 * chose, and saying so stops five actions reading as five things the installer
 * decided on its own.
